## üöÄ Description

The **Book Search Engine** is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) application that allows users to search for books using the Google Books API, save their favorite books to their account, and manage their saved books. This application has been refactored to use **GraphQL** with **Apollo Server**, replacing the previous RESTful API. It provides a seamless and dynamic user experience for avid readers who want to keep track of books they are interested in.
